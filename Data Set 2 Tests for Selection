CALCULATING TAJIMA'S D (POPOOLATION1)

(a) Run script to calculate Tajima's D

- Found in the file "TAJIMAS_D_PK.sh"

(b) Transfer .D files to your local machine

    scp cristina@info.mcmaster.ca:/4/cristina/sequence_analysis_paul/tajimas_d_PK/*.D .
    
VISUALIZING TAJIMA'S D (R-STUDIO)

- Using the script "R script: Tajima's D plots"
- This script includes the proportions above and below 0 as well
- Some stats that were obtained:

CREATE .MPILEUP

- Even though I have pileup files, I am going to create a merged pileup of Paul’s final bam files so that I can create a sync file to use in the PoPoolation2 analysis
- Flags (Same as before):

	B = Disable BAQ (base alignment quality) computation (which stops probabilistic 	realignment for potential misaligned SNPs, but some also SNPs should not affect the results for the evolved pooled populations)
	Q 0 = Quality score at 0 because we’ve done so many quality checks before (did 	quality of 20 in previous scripts)
	f = Path to reference sequence
	
- The script itself is called "MPILEUP_PK.sh"

CREATE SYNC FILE

- The same final two steps as the pipeline for Data Set 1
- Script can be found under "SYNC_PK.sh
- Flags:

	ea: enable assertions
	Xmx12g: Which allocates Java 12 Gb of memory (Sarah used 32, but I again am going to 	try with less since Paul does not have as much data)

- Now we are ready to use the sync file for PoPoolation2 analysis

SUBSAMPLING (POPOOLATION2)

- Yes...I made this same mistake twice...but since I did, I'll still include the subsampling script for Paul's data because the script itself is correct, it just should have been done for Tajima's D...the script is called "SUBSAMPLE_PK.sh"

CALCULATE FST (POPOOLATION2)

- Order of Paul’s bam files so that we know which pairwise comparison is which (the program will compare 1/2, 1/3 etc so for example that might be MDG3 vs F33ConR1, and MDG3 vs F77ConR1 etc:

	1.  F115ConR1_TAGCTT_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	2.  F115ConR2_GGCTAC_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	3.  F38ConR1_ATCACG_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	4.  F38ConR2_TTAGGC_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	5.  F77ConR1_ATGTCA_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	6.  F77ConR2_ATTCCT_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	7.  MGD3_SO_CAGATC_merged_aligned_pe.final_realigned.bam
	
(a) Run script to calculate Fst

- In the file "FST_PK.sh"

(b) . Transfer .fst file to local machine

	scp cristina@info.mcmaster.ca:/4/cristina/sequence_analysis_paul/popool2_PK/*.fst .
	
VISUALIZING FST (R-STUDIO)

- Same two scripts to separate the files and generate plots as Sarah's date, but with the necesarry changes to the working directory etc ("R script: Separate fst comparisons" and "R script: Fst plots")
