CALCULATING TAJIMA'S D (POPOOLATION1)

(a) Run script to calculate Tajima's D

- Found in the file "TAJIMAS_D_PK.sh"

(b) Transfer .D files to your local machine

    scp cristina@info.mcmaster.ca:/4/cristina/sequence_analysis_paul/tajimas_d_PK/*.D .
    
VISUALIZING TAJIMA'S D (R-STUDIO)

- Using the script "R script: Tajima's D plots"
- This script includes the proportions above and below 0 as well
- Some stats that were obtained:

CREATE .MPILEUP

- Even though I have pileup files, I am going to create a merged pileup of Paul’s final bam files so that I can create a sync file to use in the PoPoolation2 analysis
- Flags (Same as before):

	B = Disable BAQ (base alignment quality) computation (which stops probabilistic 	realignment for potential misaligned SNPs, but some also SNPs should not affect the results for the evolved pooled populations)
	Q 0 = Quality score at 0 because we’ve done so many quality checks before (did 	quality of 20 in previous scripts)
	f = Path to reference sequence
	
- The script itself is called "MPILEUP_PK.sh"

CREATE SYNC FILE

- The same final two steps as the pipeline for Data Set 1
- Script can be found under "SYNC_PK.sh
- Now we are ready to use the sync file for PoPoolation2 analysis
