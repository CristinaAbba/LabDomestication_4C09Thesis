CALCULATING TAJIMA'S PI (POPOOLATION1)

- PoPoolation1 = Estimating natural variaiton in pooled populations using next generation sequencing
- What can you do with PoPoolation?

	Genome wide overview of natural variation
	Detailed inspection of candidate genes
	Calcualte divergence between species
	Calculate natural variation for genes (allows subsequent GO analysis)
	
- Quick reminder about positive selection - When an allele increases in its population frequency, nearby variants also increase in its frequency - known as hitchhiking 
- This leads to a selective sweep which erases variation around a positively selected allele
- After the sweep:

	New mutations appear and restore diversity, but they appear very slowly (mutations are 	rare) and they are initially of low frequency
	Positive selection thus creates a signature consisting of a region of low overall diversity with an excess of rare alleles - rare alleles are very important (SNP 	identification) - LOW TAJIMA’S D
	Of course there are many more signatures of positive selection, like the proportion of 	functional change (McDonald Kreitman Test), length of the haplotypes (iHS and linkage 	disequilibrium) or differences in allele frequencies between populations (Fst)
	
- PoPoolation currently calculates:

	1. Tajima's pi
	2. Watterson's theta
	3. Tajima's D

- Thus far I have been using mostly Sarah’s scripts as a guide because I have been working with her data, but for calculating Tajima’s pi I’ve looked to Paul’s scripts for guidelines because for his project he completed the analysis, so these are his steps:

(a) Create necessary directories

	mkdir pileup_files_SM
	mkdir tajimas_pi_SM
	mkdir wattersons_theta_SM
	mkdir tajimas_d_SM
	
(b) Create .pileup files for every .bam file	

- Each generated .bam file needs to be in .pileup format for the use in Popoolation1
- Flags:

	B = Disable BAQ (base alignment quality)
	Q = Minimum base quality (already filtered for 20, default is 13, but since this step has already been completed in the past Paul just set this to 0 because we don’t need to worry about it 
	f = Path to reference sequence
	
- The script for this step is called "PILEUP_SM.sh"

(c) Run script to calculate Tajima's pi

- Tajima's pi represents the sum of the pairwise differences divided by the number of the pairs, essentially this is an 'average' calculation, representing the average nucleotide diversity
- Flags - Paul went through the different flags with me and we discussed what it would mean to change certain options, but at this point the only flag that will be different is the pool size, Sarah’s pool sequencing was done with 100 individuals, which means 200 chromosomes

	input = Input pileup file
	output = File with Tajima’s Pi calculated
	measure [pi] =Poptions include Tajima’s Pi or Watterson’s Theta or Tajima’s D along chromosomes using a sliding window approach
	window-size [10000] = Size of the sliding window
	step-size [10000] = How far to move along with chromosome (if step size is 	smaller, the windows will overlap
	min-coverage [4] = Minimum coverage (not important if subsampling was done)
	max-coverage [400] = Maximum coverage
	min-qual [20] = Minimum base quality (we already filtered for 20 in previous steps)
	pool-size [200] = Number of chromosomes (double the number of individuals per pool)
	fast-q type [sanger] = Depending on the encoding of the fastq files (we had indicated phred33 previously, so this will remain consistent)
	min-covered-fraction [0.5] = Minimum percentage of sites having sufficient coverage in the given window (0.5 was what was used in the example)
	
- The script used to calculate Tajima's pi is "TAJIMAS_PI_SM.sh"
- Realized after running this script that the maximum coverage of 400 that had been set would not be high enough for the ancestor which had been sequenced at a much higher coverage (approx. 600x)
- So made another script to calculate Tajima's pi for the ancestor where the maximum coverage was changed to 800, it is titled "TAJIMAS_PI_ANCESTOR_SM.sh"

(d) Move .pi files to local machine

	scp cristina@info.mcmaster.ca:/4/cristina/sequence_analysis_sarah/tajimas_pi_SM/*.pi .

VISUALIZING TAJIMA's PI (R-STUDIO)

- At first I had tried to create outputs in .pdf from PoPoolation, but that didn't work so I asked Paul for help visualizing Tajima's pi using R scripts
- Paul's scripts can be found on his Github page (Paul Knoops/episodicSequenceData), I used the same ones with modifications in the colours, axis etc.
- One thing to remember for R is to set working directory in the directory where your data is
So for example, for my .pi data, my working directory is cristin/Desktop/tajimas_pi_SM
- The complete R script for these plots is provided under "R script: Tajima's pi plots"
- Using R I also generated some simple stats values from the graphs, just values such as mean, minimum and maximum

	Pi_PlotFunction('ANCESTOR_ALL_aligned_merged.sorted.final.pi’, “Pi Plot")
	Minimum: 0.000175 (on the X chromosome)
	Maximum: 0.018779 (on chromosome 3R)

CALCULATING WATTERSON'S THETA (POPOOLATION1)

- Watterson's theta estimate of variation is derived from the number of segregating sites.  
- Since I already created output directories for Tajima's pi, Watterson's theta and Tajima's D, I can just jump right into calculating theta with its own script

(a) Run script to calculate Watterson's theta

- Can be found under the file "W_THETA_SM.sh"
- The same realization applies to the theta values as the Tajima's pi, this script also had a maximum coverage of 400
- So made another script to calculate Watterson's theta for the ancestor where the maximum coverage was changed to 800, it is titled "W_THETA_ANCESTOR_SM.sh"

(b) Move .theta files to local machine

	scp cristina@info.mcmaster.ca:/4/cristina/sequence_analysis_sarah/wattersons_theta_SM/*.theta .
