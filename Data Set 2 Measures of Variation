Data Set 2 was borrowed from Paul Knoops' Predation reseach (original sequenced data from Michael DeNieu at Michigan State University)

- For Paul's sequence data, I am starting with the final .bam files (pipeline completed all the way up to GATK realiner), so all I have to do is create the necessary directories and .pileup files for his data, and then can jump right into the analysis
- A note on naming conventions for Paul's data:

    F38 = Description of the generation (generational time points include 38, 77 and 115)
    Con = Description of the type of population; These are Paul's 'Control' populations
    TAGCTT = Tag/label
    R1 = Biological replicate (So there are 2 Control replicate populations and this goes for each generation)
    MGD3 = Ancestor population
    
CALCULATING TAJIMA'S PI

(a) Create necessary directories

    mkdir pileup_files_PK
    mkdir tajimas_pi_PK
    mkdir wattersons_theta_PK
    mkdir tajimas_d_PK
    
(b) Create .pileup for every .bam file

- The script for this step is called "PILEUP_PK.sh"
- The names for the scripts from each data set are the same, with the exception of the initials to represent which data set it is being applied to; SM for Sarah's in Data Set 1 and PK for Paul's in Data Set 2

(c) Run script to calculate Tajima's pi

- The script to calculate Tajima's pi for this data set is "TAJIMAS_PI_PK.sh
- Note for Paul's data the pool size is changed to 120 because he had 60 individuals sequenced in a pool
