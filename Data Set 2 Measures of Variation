Data Set 2 was borrowed from Paul Knoops' Predation reseach (original sequenced data from Michael DeNieu at Michigan State University)

- For Paul's sequence data, I am starting with the final .bam files (pipeline completed all the way up to GATK realiner), so all I have to do is create the necessary directories and .pileup files for his data, and then can jump right into the analysis
- A note on naming conventions for Paul's data:

    F38 = Description of the generation (generational time points include 38, 77 and 115)
    Con = Description of the type of population; These are Paul's 'Control' populations
    TAGCTT = Tag/label
    R1 = Biological replicate (So there are 2 Control replicate populations and this goes for each generation)
    MGD3 = Ancestor population
